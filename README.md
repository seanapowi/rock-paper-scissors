# rock-paper-scissors
In this project, I make a 5-round simple implementation of grade-school classic game: “rock paper scissors”. 

For the game, Rock Paper Scissors, the rules are:

Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beat Paper
Paper beats Rock
If the user and computer pick the same option then it would result in a tie.

If the user and computer get a tie for each of the 5 rounds then no one wins and they can play again.
